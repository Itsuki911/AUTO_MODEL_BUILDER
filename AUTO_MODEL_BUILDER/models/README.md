# README for Models Directory

This directory contains the trained AI models generated by the Automatic AI Model Development System. Each model is saved in a format compatible with popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and scikit-learn.

## Purpose

The models stored in this directory are the result of the automated model training process, which includes data generation, model selection, training, and evaluation. These models can be used for various tasks such as classification, regression, and natural language processing.

## Structure

- **Model Files**: The trained models are saved in formats such as `.pt` for PyTorch and `.pkl` for scikit-learn.
- **Documentation**: Additional documentation regarding each model's architecture, training parameters, and performance metrics may be included alongside the model files.

Please refer to the main project documentation for more details on how to utilize these models in your applications.
